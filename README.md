# Queue
Implementation of queue using lists, with the following functions: push(elem), pop(), front(), back(), empty(), clear(), size().
I utilizated the queue resolving the following problem: 
  There is a list of candidates for an exam that lasts 2 days with a certain amount of time a day. The candidates receive a random time around 5-15. After the first day, the remaining candidates are put in a queue for the next day.
